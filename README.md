## Description:
Consumes Mercado Libre's API. Shows your products in fullfillment and their available quantity.

While this has a real functionality in a business, this is primarily an educational project.

## What I Learned:
- Web App Architecture. This program uses:
 - Front End: React
 - Back End: Node/Express
 - Database: Redis ( and Caching)
- Better understanding of Authorization and Authentication.
- Docker

## What I Discovered:
There's a lot to learn about:
- Web App Architecture.
I knew this was going to be a really simple app, so ( at least with my today's knowledge ) I believe this structure was correct.
- JWT, PassportJs, Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito.
